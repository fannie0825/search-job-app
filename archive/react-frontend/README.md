# React Frontend (Archived)

This folder contains React/Vite frontend files that are **not needed** for the Streamlit deployment.

## What's Here

- React components (`App.jsx`, `components/`, etc.)
- Vite configuration (`vite.config.js`, `package.json`)
- Frontend-specific files (`.env.example`, etc.)

## For Streamlit Deployment

**You don't need these files.** The main application is `app.py` (Streamlit).

## If You Want to Use React Later

These files are kept here for reference. If you want to use the React frontend:
1. Move files back to root
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Run: `npm start`
4. Deploy to Vercel/Netlify (not Streamlit Cloud)

**For now, focus on Streamlit app only!**
